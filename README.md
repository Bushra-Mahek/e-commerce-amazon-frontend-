E-Commerce Shopping Cart Application

A responsive e-commerce front-end application built with vanilla JavaScript that simulates a complete checkout experience. The project emphasizes clean code, modular design, and reliability through a comprehensive suite of unit tests written with the Jasmine framework.

Developed an interactive shopping cart allowing users to add, update quantities, and delete items, with all changes dynamically reflected on the page without a reload.

Engineered a modular system where the cart, order summary, and page header operate as independent but interconnected components.

Implemented a robust testing suite using Jasmine, creating over 20 specific unit tests to verify DOM rendering, user interactions (like deleting items), and data calculations.

Designed a fully responsive, mobile-first layout using advanced CSS techniques to ensure a seamless user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), Jasmine Testing Framework
